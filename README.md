This application can help you and your team to manage your LFS file locks, on both Windows and
Linux. It is written in
Python with PyQt5 and
built using PyInstaller, so you do not need Python to be installed on your system.

The app was specifically made for projects based on Unreal Engine 4/5 in combination with the
amazing Git LFS plugin
by [ProjectBorealis](https://github.com/ProjectBorealis/UEGitPlugin) (forked
from [SRomBauts](https://github.com/SRombauts/UEGitPlugin)). However, it can be used for any other
LFS-initialized
repository.

Pull requests are very welcome.

## Features

- Add and remove locks
- Filter and search locks

- Cross-platform (Windows and Linux)
- Dark mode ðŸ˜Ž

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Git and Git LFS installed
2. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/chillpert/lfs-lock-manager/releases) and ship it
   with your project
3. Ensure that `settings.ini` is in the same directory as the executable
4. Configure `settings.ini` (at the very least, you need to modify `projectRootDirectory`)

## Build yourself

Run `pyinstaller LfsLockManager.spec` to create your executable. By default, it will be placed
in `./dist`. Copy an
updated version of `settings.ini` to `./dist`.

## TODO

- [ ] Investigate overhead for (un)locking operations
- [ ] Add user setting for using '/' or '\\' when generating commands (only relevant for custom
  git-lfs executables)
- [ ] Bug: Selection sometimes persists after certain actions
- [ ] Bug: After force unlocking another user's locks, the app switches to own locks again
- [ ] Bug: The current selection gets wiped when filtering using a string that does not match
  anything in the file tree
